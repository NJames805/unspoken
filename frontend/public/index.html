                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>We are a passionate mime group that began our journey at Ebenezer Preparatory School. United by our love for Jesus Christ, we have dedicated ourselves to sharing His message through the art of mime. Our performances take us from church to church, where we aim to inspire, uplift, and connect with audiences of all ages. Through our creative expressions and movements, we strive to communicate the love and teachings of Christ in a unique and powerful way. Join us as we continue to spread the joy and hope of the Gospel, one performance at a time.</p>
